# Library Management System
# Overview
This is a simple C++ program that simulates a library management system. It allows users to register, borrow books, magazines, journals, and electronic items. Librarians can add new books to the library's collection.

# Features
User Registration: Users can register with their name, user type (e.g., student, faculty), and phone number. Each user is assigned a unique ID.

Borrowing Items: Users can borrow books, magazines, journals, ebooks, and electronic items from the library. The system keeps track of borrowed items and their due dates.

Location Tracking: Users can inquire about the location of specific library items (books, magazines, and journals).

Librarian Portal: Librarians have access to a portal where they can add new books to the library's collection. They can specify book details such as title, author, ISBN, and the number of copies to be added.

Borrow on Loan: Users can request to borrow items on loan, specifying the library branch and the requested date.
